2021-2022 (C) Arezalgamer89's FUBNOUT (Fair use but not owner use) Custom License
You are reading version 1.0 of FUBNOUT

DISCLAIMER:
FUBNOUT should only be used on Arezalgamer89 (and/or his teams 'n' friends)'s works,
The reason because of that is because this license connects (*and refers*) Arezal's work
"FUBNOUT" is a word locked for Arezal's works
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The use
FUBNOUT's license name comes from it's use, 'Fair but not owner'
The whole point of this license was to reduce developers (or just arezal's) stress about their content being stolen
by other people and showing it as their own. 
BY ACCEPTING THIS LICENSE, YOU PLACE THAT WE TRUST YOU NOT STEALING OUR STUFF, AND THAT YOU ACTUALLY READ THIS


What can't and can you do?

Simple, this process is similar to The Unlicense and GNU Public Att 3.0

You can modify, make an improvement, make yourself an template and probably more
This should not apply to the files (and/or contents) that have: 'CQPI1' over them

However YOU CANNOT SELL/REDISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSON FROM AREZAL OR DEVS (THIS APPLIES TO COMMERCIAL ATTRIBUTES TOO, YOU'RE CAUGHT ON THE SPOT DOING THAT)
YOU CAN USE THE APPROVED PARTS THAT DON'T HAVE 'CQPI1' OVER THEM AS MENTIONED BEFORE
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DOWNLOAD AND MODIFY LESS THAN 70 CHANGES THEN REDISTRIBUTE, RENAME AND/OR CLAIM OWNERSHIP OF THE SMALL-EDITED DISTRIBUTION




CQPI1 (Copyright Quarters Pan Indstury (joke))

CQP1 is an One-Line Use Copy-Prevention marker for FUBNOUT
If you found this Line over/top/bottom of an code, it means it's FULLY copyrighted by the people that copyrighted them
However, this goes top extremely-strict, as even crediting properly is not gonna make an effort,
The only situation allowed when in this state, is tutorials and nothing else
