# Hello World Big Master Branch
*WARNING: Unstable because of the PRs*

Oh boy! Where all the magic happened and happens!

## Disclaimer
*If your issue is related to the `master` branch, try NOT using the branch, Use the release `Branch` and `Release`s*

# Hello World Repo
This is the repo where i plan to collect and code Hello World in many possible platforms as possible in only *one* repository

# Python
The Python version is much easier, all you need is a command prompt, then go to the python folder and type the python file name [e.g C:\users\**user**\desktop\python\helloworldadv.py]

### Dummy note for ERRORers
If so happens that you cannot run the code for python, use the code below and see if it works:

```python
print("Hello World!")
input()
```

# Lua
The Lua one is a little bit more involving, First, you have to install lua which you can at [here](https://github.com/rjpcomputing/luaforwindows/releases), or if you don't want to involve in these kind of stuff, you can just run the simple demo at [here](https://www.lua.org/cgi-bin/demo?hello).
## A Dummy Note again
Note that you still need an Lua Intrepeter, See

### Intrepeter Method
1. Open it, (Or type `lua` in your terminal/cmd)
2. type in:
```lua
print("Hello World") -- Yes, Just that
```
### File Method
1. Make a lua file called `whatevershithere.lua`
2. Copy paste this in:
```lua
-- Hello Worldy, DUMB MODE
print("Hello World")
```
